After I attended my first meetup and set up the linux environment on my laptop, I was ready to continue coding. But I had a decision to make. Should I...
* Keep working on my last pset for cs50
* Start the Odin project
* Start Free Code Camp

There were multiple days where I didn't know what to do which left me doing nothing. If I wanted to do CodeClub and work on projects, then I felt like I needed to start learning Ruby yesterday and in that case, the Odin project seemed like a good idea. A lot of people seemed to like free code camp, but I couldn't really do that and do ruby projects with CodeClub. And then on the other hand, I only had one more pset to go, surely it would be good to just finish it and then move on rather than letting it hang out there.

On July 21, 2017 I started the Odin Project. On July 23, 2017 I quit the Odin Project.

July 21, 2017 marks the day that I made my decision. I read that it didn't really matter what language you learned as long as you learned it well and did a lot of projects with it. Given that and the fact that I didn't want to lose out on the opportunity to work on projects with other people learning to code at CodeClub, it was an easy decision. There was no point to finishing the last pset right now because A) it wasn't in ruby and B) I needed to learn ruby as quickly as possible, so that I could get up to speed.

July 23, 2017 marks the day that I attended the FreeCodeCamp meetup in Oakland. I didn't know much about Free Code Camp; I thought it was just a group of people that worked on coding together and helped each other. I wasn't spectacularly incorrect, but I didn't quite have the whole picture. I didn't know that free code camp was essentially a curriculum for learning web development with full stack javascript. So there I was stupidly sitting at the table at a freecodecamp meetup when I didn't know what freecodecamp was let alone follow the curriculum.

But nonetheless, it got me thinking. What does the internet think, the Odin project or FCC?

The answer was a resounding FCC. The score was ~10-0. The more I looked the more I found redditors advising to do FCC over the Odin Project. And the reason? Turns out Ruby is kind of on the decline while full stack javascript was on the rise. And that was pretty much the only reason. And on that day I began my FCC journey.

For all the structure I had working on Udacity intro to CS and then moving on to edX Harvard cs50, between July 21 and July 23 I had gone from having no idea what to do to for sure doing the Odin Project to 100% sold on FCC.
