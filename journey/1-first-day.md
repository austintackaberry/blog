Today is August 10th, 2017. I started my coding journey on May 27th, 2017. That's 75 days ago. It feels so long ago, yet at the same time just like it was yesterday. It was memorial day weekend, and I didn't have any plans.

For awhile I was debating whether or not I should look into a career change. I went to Purdue University for chemical engineering and got a job in the bay area as a process engineer at an oil refinery. Though oil is certainly not dead, it seems to me that it is heading in that direction. Even if it is slow and lasts through my lifetime, I can easily say with confidence that it is not an exciting industry. There is still innovation for sure, but in general, the money is made not by innovation and new design but by operating until failure. Everyone's goal in oil refining is to operate safely while minimizing equipment replacements. I think the average age of equipment in refineries is roughly 20-30 years. Sure there are plenty of interesting challenges and a lot of smart people but at the same time there are a lot of challenges caused by old equipment drawings and a lack of documentation.

Back to the career change. Mostly, when I would think about a career change, it was mostly about whether or not I should get an MBA. I could quit my job and pursue a full-time MBA or stay and try to get my company to pay for most of the MBA. I had heard that the best route is to do full-time because the main value of the MBA is the connections and the networking. This could allow me to pivot into consulting, investment banking, or a startup, but it was hard to get over the fact that top MBA programs are $50k per year tuition, and that's not even taking into consideration the opportunity cost of not working. I have always been interested in entrepreneurship, but starting a small business with $100k in debt doesn't sound like the greatest idea. Even if I go into investment banking or consulting, is it even worth the ($100k + lost salary) investment?

Enter coding. On May 27th, 2017 I was stumbling around the web again researching about getting an MBA. One thing led to another, and I found myself reading about software engineering. I knew someone who had made the career change from chemical engineering to software engineering through a coding bootcamp, but for whatever reason I never really considered it. The average salary and job demand (from Bureau of Labor and Statistics) caught my attention, but the (seemingly) low barrier to entry kept my attention. It seemed that it was possible to learn it all on your own for free or attend a 3-6 month coding bootcamp for $15k. And you could actually make the transition and get a job! This was mind-blowing to me because in oil and gas you need a traditional 4 year chemical engineering degree. You can't even transition over from chemistry or mechanical engineering. You need a 4 year degree. Even if you are super motivated, read all the textbooks, and prove, yes prove that you are capable of doing the job, you still need a 4 year degree. The entry level interviews are all behavioral. If you have a good gpa, they assume you are technically capable, so all of the interview is "tell me about a time when..."

But software engineering industry allows anyone from any background to enter as long as they know what they are doing? It seemed too good to be true, so I kept searching and reading. I guess it makes sense; in chemical engineering you can't really practice your craft unless you have a manufacturing plant at your disposal. In software engineering, all you need is a computer, and everyone has a computer. I found the Google Guide to Technical Development, and it was 100% online and free. The site states  

"The guide lists topics and resources in a rough progression, from possible places to begin if you have little or no technical skills, to resources for those with increasing skills, to ways to gain exposure in the Computer Sciences field."

Sure it doesn't promise anything or claim that completing the listed courses will lead to a job at Google. It states that they are to be used as a supplement to students' courses required to graduate (presumably to prevent the "I quit school to complete the Google recommended coursework and still didn't get a job" nonsense). It was mind-blowing to me that a company like Google would go out on a limb and release a technical guide about how to work for them, and it doesn't include a 4-year degree.

So at this point I was convinced. I had found blogs about people who made the switch, read some CS questions on Quora, and browsed /r/learnprogramming and /r/cscareerquestions on reddit. It seemed that it was very possible (yet difficult) to make the career switch in a reasonable amount of time.

Ok so I'm doing this. All kinds of thoughts flooded my brain. Why didn't I consider this earlier? Why didn't I get a CS degree in college? Where do I start? Bootcamp or self-taught? I didn't dwell on the first two questions too much because what's the point. The last two, though, were a little tricky. I continued to read (mostly on reddit) about the pros and cons of either. The pros and cons of bootcamps as I saw them seemed to be:

PROS
* Structured learning ensures that you learn what you need to know and not what you don't need to know (this is more important than I originally thought)
* Structured learning ensures that you stay focused and motivated
* Access to mentors, peers to help you when you are stuck on technical problems
* Access to mentors, peers to help you when you are stuck mentally

CONS
* They cost money
* The good ones are full-time, so I would have to quit my job
* All the material in the bootcamp can be found online

I ultimately decided to do self-taught learning because 1) I am cheap and 2) it would allow me to delay the decision. Ok, cool. So now I'm going to learn to code. Now what.
